# Session_8

Assignment is to train and test with resnet18 model. Code has to be in modularized.

# modules:
1. Main.py:         Controller module. It can orchestrate the workflow to load data, train and test a model
2. dataloader.py:   This is the data loader module. 
3. model_resnet.py: Defines Resnet18 model
4. utils.py:        Utilities to display sample images etc
5. training.py:     Defines function for creating a model, print model summary, test the model
6. testing.py:      Defines function testing a trained model, display statts about hits and misses in prediction.

# Model
Resnet18 

# Optimizer
scheduler used (please refer to training.py)

# Regularization:
Batch Norm (please refer to model_resnet.py)
